### Implemented Features

1. Flipping Cards

Account cards flip on click. Back side of the card contains avatar, full name of the user and a social account logo

2. Drag & Drop Cards

All cards can be dragged and dropped. Initially I used "React Beautiful DnD" library, however, I found out that this library deals poorly with two dimensional lists. Then, I tried another library called "React Easy Sort", which works very well.

3. LocalStorage

Evey change made by user is stored in localStorage and thus persists on refresh.
